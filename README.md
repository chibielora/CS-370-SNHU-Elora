# Cs-370 - Current/Emerging Trends in CS

### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

1. Pathfinders are a class of algorithms used in reinforcement learning to optimize the policy function that maps observations to actions. In Keras, I implemented my agent, or pirate, by defining a custom function that took in the state, action, and reward as inputs, making it return to me with the new state and the expected reward.

### Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

#### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

1. The role of a computer scientist varies depending on the specific field and job. They may work in software development, research and development, data analysis, networking, cybersecurity, or many other areas. Regardless of the specific role, computer scientists must be able to work effectively in teams, communicate effectively with others, and continually learn and adapt to new technologies. 

#### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

2. Computer science involves studying the nature of computing and the ways in which it processes information. This includes developing new computational models, designing new algorithms and software to solve problems, and understanding how computers work at a fundamental level. The main work of a computer scientist is to approach problems creatively and systematically, breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components to identify its potential solutions.

#### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

3. Computer scientists must maintain confidentiality and act professionally in their work. They must follow the ethical and legal guidelines set by their employer or the industry in which they work. This includes protecting sensitive data and avoiding conflicts of interest. They must also adhere to the policies and procedures of their employer or the industry in which they work, aiming to protect the end user's data above all else.
